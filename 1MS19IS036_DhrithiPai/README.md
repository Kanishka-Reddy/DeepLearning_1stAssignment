### The percentage of anomalies is 80%

#### Alloted dataset: 31.txt

Following are the steps:                                   
1. Import pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.
2. Load data using pd.read_csv
3. Calculate mean, median and mode for all columns.
4. Use percentile to find outliers.
5. Visualize outliers
6. Delete verified outliers.
7. Scale the data to fit in a particular range using Maximum Absolute Scaling and MinMax Scaling 

### Formulas used
#### Mean = sum(X) / len(X)
#### Median = mid(sorted(X))
#### Min Max Scaler x' = (x - min(X)) / (max(X) - min(X))
#### Max Absolute Scaler is x' = x / max(abs(X))
